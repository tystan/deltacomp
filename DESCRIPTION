Description: Provided data containing an outcome variable, compositional variables and additional covariates (optional); regress the outcome variable on an isometric log ratio (ilr) transformation of the linearly dependent compositional variables. The package provides predictions (with confidence intervals) in the change (delta) in the outcome/response variable based on the multiple linear regression model and evenly spaced reallocations of the compositional values.
